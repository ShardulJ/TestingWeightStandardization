# TestingWeightStandardization

This project demonstrates the implementation of **Weight Standardization** as a technique to enhance neural network training. It includes the application of this method on a **ResNet** architecture and trains the model on the CIFAR-10 dataset.


## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShardulJ/TestingWeightStandardization.git
   cd TestingWeightStandardization
   ```

2. Install Dependencies:
   ```
   pip install requirements.txt
   ```

## Models

- **Weight Standardization**: Implemented in `src/utils/weight_standardization.py` using a custom convolutional layer (`WSConv2d`).
- **ResNet Architecture**: Defined in `src/models/resnet.py`, including a modified version with bottleneck blocks(not implemented yet).

## Testing the Resnet
